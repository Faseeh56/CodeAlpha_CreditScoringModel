# 🏦 Credit Scoring Model - CodeAlpha Internship

This project predicts an individual's creditworthiness using financial data such as income, debt, payment history, and more. Built as part of the **CodeAlpha Machine Learning Internship**.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

- **Goal:** Classify whether a person is creditworthy or not.
- **Algorithms Used:** Logistic Regression, Random Forest
- **Dataset:** Synthetic financial dataset with realistic features
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, ROC-AUC

## 📊 Features Used

- `annual_income`
- `current_debt`
- `credit_utilization`
- `credit_history_length`
- `num_of_credit_cards`
- `missed_payments`
- `num_of_loans`
- `loan_default_history`
- `monthly_expenses`
- `savings_balance`

## 🧠 ML Workflow

1. Data Generation (simulated realistic data)
2. Preprocessing with StandardScaler
3. Model Training (Logistic Regression & Random Forest)
4. Evaluation with Classification Report & ROC-AUC
5. Visualized ROC Curve and Feature Importances

## 📉 ROC Curve

*(Optional - Add your saved plot)*

---

## ✅ Results

Both models performed well, with Random Forest showing slightly better results based on ROC-AUC score.
